            "response": "Let's assume the number of books Anne has is A, the number of books Charlie has is C, and the number of books Elise has is E.\n\nFrom the given information, we can form the following equations:\n1) A + C + E = 217  (equation 1)\n2) 3A + 3C + 3E = 651  (equation 2)\n3) A + C = E + 75  (equation 3)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can start by simplifying equation 2:\n3A + 3C + 3E = 651\nDividing both sides by 3:\nA + C + E = 217\n\nComparing this simplified equation with equation 1, we can see that they are the same. This means equation 2 is redundant and does not provide any new information.\n\nNow, let's solve equations 1 and 3 simultaneously:\nA + C + E = 217\nA + C = E + 75\n\nSubtracting equation 3 from equation 1:\n(A + C + E) - (A + C) = (217) - (E + 75)\nE = 217 - E - 75\n2E = 142\nE = 71\n\nSubstituting the value of E into equation 3:\nA + C = 71 + 75\nA + C = 146\n\nWe know that Anne and Charlie together have 146 books. Since we are looking for the number of books Charlie has, we can assign the value of A to Anne and the value of C to Charlie.\n\nTherefore, Charlie has C = 146 - A books.\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of A and E into equation 1 to find the value of C:\nA + C + E = 217\nA + (146 - A) + 71 = 217\n146 + 71 - A = 217\n217 - A = 217 - 146 - 71\n-A = 0\nA = 0\n\nSince A = 0, it means Anne has no books. Therefore, Charlie has C = 146 - A = 146 - 0 = 146 books.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Charlie has 146 books.",

If Charlie had double the crayons, together with Anne they would have 222 crayons. If Charlie had 3 times the crayons, together they would all have 407 crayons. Anne has 55 less crayons than Daniel. How many crayons does Anne have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 2a + b = 222; 3a + b + c = 407; b - c = -55;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution.

How many books does Charlie have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can set up a system of equations:\n\nLet's assume Anne has a books, Charlie has c books, and Elise has e books.\n\nFrom the given information, we have the following equations:\n\n1) a + c + e = 217 (Equation 1: Together they have 217 books)\n2) 3a + 3c + 3e = 651 (Equation 2: If everyone had three times the amount of books, together they would have 651 books)\n3) a + c = e + 75 (Equation 3: Anne and Charlie together have 75 more books than Elise)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use the elimination method:\n\nFrom Equation 1, we can rewrite it as:\na = 217 - c - e\n\nSubstituting this value of a in Equation 2, we get:\n3(217 - c - e) + 3c + 3e = 651\n651 - 3c - 3e + 3c + 3e = 651\n-3c + 3c - 3e + 3e = 651 - 651\n0 = 0\n\nThis means that Equation 2 is redundant and does not provide any additional information.\n\nNow, let's substitute the value of a + c from Equation 3 into Equation 1:\ne + 75 + e = 217\n2e + 75 = 217\n2e = 217 - 75\n2e = 142\ne = 142/2\ne = 71\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of e into Equation 3 to find the value of a + c:\na + c = 71 + 75\na + c = 146\n\nSince we don't have any specific information about the individual values of a and c, we cannot determine them separately. However, we can determine their sum.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is [FINAL ANSWER] The sum of the number of books Anne and Charlie have is 146.",

Anne and Charlie together have 43 more pencils than Bob. Charlie and Bob together have 128 pencils. If Anne had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 317 pencils. How many pencils does Anne have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's assign variables to represent the number of pencils each person has. Let's say Anne has \"a\" pencils, Charlie has \"c\" pencils, and Bob has \"b\" pencils.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following equations:\n\n1) Anne and Charlie together have 43 more pencils than Bob:\na + c = b + 43\n\n2) Charlie and Bob together have 128 pencils:\nc + b = 128\n\n3) If Anne had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 317 pencils:\n3a + c + b = 317\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations with three variables. We can solve this system to find the values of \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\".\n\nFirst, let's solve equation 1) for \"b\":\nb = a + c - 43\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \"b\" in equation 2):\nc + (a + c - 43) = 128\n2c + a = 171   (equation 4)\n\nNext, substitute the expression for \"b\" in equation 3):\n3a + c + (a + c - 43) = 317\n4a + 2c = 360   (equation 5)\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables (equations 4 and 5). Let's solve this system:\n\nMultiply equation 4 by 2 and subtract equation 5 from it:\n(2c + a) * 2 - (4a + 2c) = 342 - 360\n2c + 2a - 4a - 2c = -18\n-2a = -18\na = 9\n\nSubstitute the value of \"a\" back into equation 4:\n2c + 9 = 171\n2c = 162\nc = 81\n\nNow, substitute the values of \"a\" and \"c\" back into equation 1) to find \"b\":\n9 + 81 = b + 43\n90 = b + 43\nb = 47\n\nTherefore, Charlie has 47 pencils.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Anne has 3 times the pencils, so Anne has 3 * 9 = 27 pencils.",

            "prompt": "You will now receive an example puzzle with an explanation how to solve it. Example puzzle: There are three people named Anne, Charlie and Bob. Charlie and Bob together have 113 more pencils than Anne. Anne and Charlie together have 96 pencils. If Anne had double the pencils, together with Charlie they would have 113 pencils. How many pencils does Charlie have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c - a = 113; a + b = 96; 2a + b = 113;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution.

If Charlie had double the books, together with Daniel they would have 59 books. How many books does Daniel have?",
            "response": "To solve the puzzle, let's assign variables to the number of books each person has. Let's say Anne has \"a\" books, Charlie has \"c\" books, and Daniel has \"d\" books.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following equations:\n\n1) If Anne had double the books, together with Charlie they would have 156 books:\n2a + c = 156\n\n2) If Anne had 3 times the books, together they would all have 263 books:\n3a + c + d = 263\n\n3) If Charlie had double the books, together with Daniel they would have 59 books:\nc + 2d = 59\n\nNow, we have a system of three equations. We can solve it using various methods, such as substitution or elimination. Let's use the substitution method.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express c in terms of a:\nc = 156 - 2a\n\nSubstitute this value of c in equations 2 and 3:\n\n3a + (156 - 2a) + d = 263\n3a - 2a + d = 263 - 156\na + d = 107   ----(4)\n\n(156 - 2a) + 2d = 59\n156 - 2a + 2d = 59\n2d - 2a = 59 - 156\n2d - 2a = -97\nd - a = -48.5   ----(5)\n\nNow, we have two equations (4) and (5) with two variables (a and d). We can solve this system of equations.\n\nAdding equation (4) and (5):\n(a + d) + (d - a) = 107 + (-48.5)\n2d = 58.5\nd = 58.5/2\nd = 29.25\n\nTherefore, Daniel has 29.25 books.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Daniel has 29.25 books.",

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 2a + b = 155; b + c - a = -34; b - c = -41;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 77.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. There are three people named Charlie, Elise and Bob. Charlie has 7 less apples than Elise. If Elise had double the apples, together with Bob they would have 206 apples. If Bob had double the apples, together with Charlie they would have 138 apples. How many apples does Charlie have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's assign variables to represent the number of apples each person has. Let's say Charlie has \"c\" apples, Elise has \"e\" apples, and Bob has \"b\" apples.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following equations:\n\n1) Charlie has 7 less apples than Elise: c = e - 7\n2) If Elise had double the apples, together with Bob they would have 206 apples: 2e + b = 206\n3) If Bob had double the apples, together with Charlie they would have 138 apples: c + 2b = 138\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations:\n\nFirst, let's substitute the value of c from equation 1 into equations 2 and 3:\n\n2e + b = 206  --> 2(e - 7) + b = 206  --> 2e - 14 + b = 206  --> 2e + b = 220  (Equation 4)\n\nc + 2b = 138  --> (e - 7) + 2b = 138  --> e - 7 + 2b = 138  --> e + 2b = 145  (Equation 5)\n\nNow, we have a system of equations with two variables (e and b). Let's solve it by eliminating one variable:\n\nMultiply equation 4 by 2:\n\n4e + 2b = 440  (Equation 6)\n\nSubtract equation 5 from equation 6:\n\n(4e + 2b) - (e + 2b) = 440 - 145\n\n3e = 295\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\ne = 98.33\n\nSince the number of apples must be a whole number, we can round e to the nearest whole number:\n\ne \u2248 98\n\nNow, substitute the value of e into equation 1 to find the value of c:\n\nc = e - 7 = 98 - 7 = 91\n\nTherefore, Charlie has 91 apples.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Charlie has 91 apples.",

Anne and Daniel together have 26 more pencils than Bob. If Daniel had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 120 pencils. Daniel and Bob together have 4 more pencils than Anne. How many pencils does Daniel have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + b - c = 26; a + 3b + c = 120; b + c - a = 4;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution.

            "response": "To solve the puzzle, we can set up a system of equations:\n\nLet's assume the number of books Bob has is represented by 'b', the number of books Anne has is represented by 'a', and the number of books Charlie has is represented by 'c'.\n\nFrom the given information, we can write the following equations:\n\n1) b + c = 140  (Bob and Charlie together have 140 books)\n2) 2b + a = 256  (If Bob had double the books, together with Anne they would have 256 books)\n3) a + c = 141  (Anne and Charlie together have 141 books)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n\nUsing the method of substitution, we can solve equations 1 and 3 to find the value of 'c':\n\nFrom equation 1, we have c = 140 - b.\n\nSubstituting this value of 'c' into equation 3, we get a + (140 - b) = 141.\nSimplifying, we have a - b = 1.  (Equation 4)\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of 'c' from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\n2b + a = 256\n2b + a = 256\n2b + (a + (140 - b)) = 256  (Substituting c = 140 - b)\n2b + a + 140 - b = 256\na + b + 140 = 256\na + b = 116  (Equation 5)\n\nNow, we have two equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5) with two variables 'a' and 'b'. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nAdding Equation 4 and Equation 5, we get:\n\n(a - b) + (a + b) = 1 + 116\n2a = 117\na = 117/2\na = 58.5\n\nNow, we have the value of 'a', which represents the number of books Anne has. However, since the number of books cannot be in decimal form, we can conclude that Anne does not have 58.5 books.\n\nTherefore, it seems there might be an error in the given information or the puzzle itself.

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c - a = 41; 2a + 2b + 2c = 398; 2c + a = 235;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 42.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. There are three people named Daniel, Anne and Charlie. If everyone had twice the amount of pencils, together they would have 382 pencils. Daniel and Anne together have 5 less pencils than Charlie. Daniel and Charlie together have 183 pencils. How many pencils does Daniel have?",
            "response": "To solve the puzzle, let's assign variables to represent the number of pencils each person has. Let's say Daniel has \"d\" pencils, Anne has \"a\" pencils, and Charlie has \"c\" pencils.\n\nWe can now translate the given information into equations:\n\n1) If everyone had twice the amount of pencils, together they would have 382 pencils:\n2d + 2a + 2c = 382\n\n2) Daniel and Anne together have 5 less pencils than Charlie:\nd + a = c - 5\n\n3) Daniel and Charlie together have 183 pencils:\nd + c = 183\n\nNow, let's solve the system of equations:\n\nWe can start by eliminating the variable \"a\" from equations 1) and 2). Multiply equation 2) by 2 to make the coefficients of \"a\" the same:\n\n2d + 2a = 2c - 10\n\nNow, subtract equation 1) from this new equation:\n\n(2d + 2a) - (2d + 2a) = (2c - 10) - (2d + 2a)\n0 = 2c - 10 - 2d - 2a\n0 = 2c - 2d - 2a - 10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n-2a = 2c - 2d - 10\n2a = -2c + 2d + 10\na = -c + d + 5\n\nNow, substitute this expression for \"a\" in equation 1):\n\n2d + 2(-c + d + 5) + 2c = 382\n2d - 2c + 2d + 10 + 2c = 382\n4d + 10 = 382\n4d = 382 - 10\n4d = 372\nd = 372/4\nd = 93\n\nTherefore, [FINAL ANSWER] Daniel has 93 pencils.",

Let's say Bob has \"b\" pencils, Elise has \"e\" pencils, and Daniel has \"d\" pencils.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following equations:\n\n1) b + e + d = 97 (If Bob had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 97 pencils)\n2) e + d = b + 9 (Elise and Daniel together have 9 more pencils than Bob)\n3) b + d = e + 13 (Bob and Daniel together have 13 more pencils than Elise)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the method of elimination.
