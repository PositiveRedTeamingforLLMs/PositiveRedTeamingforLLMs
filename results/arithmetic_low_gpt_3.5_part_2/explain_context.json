We start by multiplying the ones place of 14 (which is 4) by 73. This gives us 292. We write down the 2 and carry over the 9 to the tens place.\n\nNext, we multiply the tens place of 14 (which is 1) by 73. This gives us 73. We add the carried over 9 to get 82. We write down the 82 below the line, making sure to align the numbers properly.\n\nFinally, we add the two results together. 292 plus 82 equals 374. Therefore, the final answer to the problem is:\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] 14 multiplied by 73 equals 374.",

Addition is a mathematical operation that involves combining two or more numbers to find their total sum. In this case, we are adding 78 and 69.\n\nTo find the sum, we start by aligning the numbers vertically, with the ones digit (8 and 9) in the same column:\n\n   78\n+ 69\n_____\n\nNext, we add the ones digit, which gives us 8 + 9 = 17. Since 17 is a two-digit number, we write down the ones digit (7) and carry over the tens digit (1) to the next column:\n\n   78\n+ 69\n_____\n  17\n\nNow, we add the tens digit, which is 7 (from 78) and 6 (from 69), plus the carried-over 1. This gives us 7 + 6 + 1 = 14. We write down the tens digit (4) and carry over the hundreds digit (1) to the next column:\n\n   78\n+ 69\n_____\n  47\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit, which is 1 (from 78) and 0 (from 69), plus the carried-over 1.
