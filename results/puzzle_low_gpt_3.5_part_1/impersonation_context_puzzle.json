Anne and Elise together have 112 apples. Daniel has 26 less apples than Anne. Together they have 140 apples. How many apples does Anne have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + b = 112; c - a = -26; a + b + c = 140;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 54.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Imagine you are the mathematician Bernhard Riemann.

If Elise had double the apples, together with Charlie they would have 168 apples. Anne and Charlie together have 60 apples. How many apples does Elise have?",

Let's go back and check our work.\n\nUpon reviewing the problem, we can see that there is a mistake in the given information. It is not possible for Anne to have 3 times the apples and Elise to have double the apples, while Charlie has a different number of apples. This means the puzzle is not solvable as given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine how many apples Elise has. [FINAL ANSWER]"

How many dollars does Elise have?",
            "response": "[FINAL ANSWER] As Sophie Germain, I will solve the problem step by step.\n\nLet's assume that Anne has x dollars. According to the problem, if Anne had 3 times the dollars, together they would all have 50 dollars. So, the total amount of money they would have is x + 3x = 4x. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n4x = 50\n\nSimplifying the equation, we find:\n\nx = 50/4\nx = 12.5\n\nThis means that Anne has 12.5 dollars.\n\nThe problem also states that Anne has 3 less dollars than Elise. So, Elise must have 12.5 + 3 = 15.5 dollars.\n\nNow, let's move on to the second part of the problem. If Elise had double the dollars, together with Bob they would have 37 dollars. Let's assume that Elise has y dollars. So, the total amount of money they would have is 2y + y + 3 = 37. Simplifying the equation, we find:\n\n3y + 3 = 37\n3y = 37 - 3\n3y = 34\ny = 34/3\ny \u2248 11.33\n\nTherefore, Elise has approximately 11.33 dollars.\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the final answer, we need to round the value. So, [FINAL ANSWER] Elise has approximately 11 dollars.",

Elise has 11 less dollars than Anne. Bob and Elise together have 104 dollars. Together they have 125 dollars. How many dollars does Elise have?",
            "response": "[FINAL ANSWER] As Sophie Germain, I would approach this problem by setting up equations based on the given information. Let's denote the amount of money Anne has as A, the amount Elise has as E, and the amount Bob has as B.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that Elise has 11 less dollars than Anne, so we can write the equation: E = A - 11.\n\nWe are also told that Bob and Elise together have 104 dollars, so we can write the equation: B + E = 104.\n\nFinally, we are given that together they have 125 dollars, so we can write the equation: A + B + E = 125.\n\nTo find the value of E, we need to solve these equations simultaneously. Let's substitute the value of E from the first equation into the other two equations:\n\nB + (A - 11) = 104,\nA + B + (A - 11) = 125.\n\nSimplifying these equations, we get:\nA + B = 115,\n2A + B = 136.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n2A + B - (A + B) = 136 - 115,\nA = 21.\n\nSubstituting this value back into the first equation, we find:\n21 + B = 115,\nB = 94.\n\nFinally, substituting the values of A and B into the equation E = A - 11, we get:\nE = 21 - 11,\nE = 10.\n\nTherefore, Elise has 10 dollars.",

            "response": "[FINAL ANSWER] Elise has 120 pencils.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\nLet's assume the number of pencils Charlie has is x.\n\nAccording to the problem, Bob and Elise together have 143 more pencils than Charlie, so their total number of pencils is (x + 143).\n\nIf everyone had three times the amount of pencils, together they would have 723 pencils. So, the equation becomes:\n3x + 3(x + 143) = 723\n3x + 3x + 429 = 723\n6x + 429 = 723\n6x = 723 - 429\n6x = 294\nx = 294/6\nx = 49\n\nSo, Charlie has 49 pencils.\n\nIf Bob had double the pencils, together with Charlie they would have 247 pencils.

As Isaac Newton answer the following problem: There are three people named Charlie, Anne and Elise. If Charlie had double the apples, together with Anne they would have 168 apples. If Elise had 3 times the apples, together they would all have 277 apples. Anne and Elise together have 87 more apples than Charlie. How many apples does Elise have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can set up a system of equations:\n\nLet's assume that Charlie has x apples, Anne has y apples, and Elise has z apples.\n\nFrom the given information, we can write the following equations:\n\n1) 2x + y = 168  (Charlie had double the apples, together with Anne they would have 168 apples)\n2) 3z + y + x = 277  (Elise had 3 times the apples, together they would all have 277 apples)\n3) y + z = x + 87  (Anne and Elise together have 87 more apples than Charlie)\n\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method:\n\nFrom equation 3, we can rewrite it as:\ny = x + 87 - z\n\nSubstitute this value of y in equations 1 and 2:\n\n1) 2x + (x + 87 - z) = 168\n3x + 87 - z = 168\n3x - z = 81  ----(4)\n\n2) 3z + (x + 87 - z) + x = 277\n2x + 2z = 190\nx + z = 95  ----(5)\n\nNow we have two equations (4) and (5) with two variables (x and z). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and z.\n\nMultiplying equation (5) by 3, we get:\n3x + 3z = 285  ----(6)\n\nSubtracting equation (4) from equation (6), we have:\n3x + 3z - (3x - z) = 285 - 81\n4z = 204\nz = 51\n\nSubstituting the value of z in equation (5), we get:\nx + 51 = 95\nx = 44\n\nNow, we can find the value of y by substituting the values of x and z in equation (3):\ny = x + 87 - z\ny = 44 + 87 - 51\ny = 80\n\nTherefore, Charlie has 44 apples, Anne has 80 apples, and Elise has 51 apples.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Elise has 51 apples.",

Bob has 47 more apples than Elise. Charlie and Elise together have 74 apples. Charlie has 79 less apples than Bob. How many apples does Bob have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b - c = 47; a + c = 74; a - b = -79;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 100.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Imagine you are the mathematician Sophie Germain.
