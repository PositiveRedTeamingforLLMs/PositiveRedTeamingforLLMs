            "response": "Let's assume that Bob has x books.\nAnne and Daniel together have 55 more books than Bob, so Anne and Daniel have x + x + 55 = 2x + 55 books.\nIf Bob had 3 times the books, together they would all have 83 books, so 3x + 2x + 55 = 83.\nCombining like terms, we get 5x + 55 = 83.\nSubtracting 55 from both sides, we get 5x = 28.\nDividing both sides by 5, we get x = 5.6.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so Bob has 5 books.\nIf Daniel had 3 times the books, together they would all have 71 books, so 3(5) + 5 + 55 = 71.\nSimplifying the equation, we get 15 + 5 + 55 = 71.\nCombining like terms, we get 75 = 71.\nThis is not a true statement, so our assumption that Daniel has 3 times the books is incorrect.\nLet's assume that Daniel has y books.\nIf Daniel had 3 times the books, together they would all have 71 books, so 3y + 5 + y + 55 = 71.\nCombining like terms, we get 4y + 60 = 71.\nSubtracting 60 from both sides, we get 4y = 11.\nDividing both sides by 4, we get y = 2.75.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a book, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so Daniel has 2 books.\nTherefore, [FINAL ANSWER] Daniel has 2 books.",

Bob and Anne together have 118 crayons. How many crayons does Anne have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 3a + 3b + 3c = 561; 2a + 2b + 2c = 374; a + c = 118;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 2a + 2b + 2c = 404; 3a + 3b + 3c = 606; 2a + b = 224;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 51.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. There are three people named Anne, Elise and Charlie. Elise and Charlie together have 90 books. If Charlie had 3 times the books, together they would all have 288 books. Elise and Charlie together have 68 more books than Anne.

Let's use the elimination method.\n\nMultiply equation 4 by 2 and equation 5 by -2:\n\n4b - 2e = 150  (equation 6)\n-4e - 2b = -400 (equation 7)\n\nAdd equations 6 and 7:\n\n4b - 2e + (-4e - 2b) = 150 + (-400)\n-4e + 4b = -250\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2e + 2b = -125  (equation 8)\n\nNow, add equation 8 to equation 5:\n\n-2e + 2b + (2e + b) = -125 + 200\n3b = 75\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\nb = 25\n\nNow substitute the value of b into equation 5:\n\n2e + 25 = 200\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n2e = 175\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ne = 87.",

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c - a = -12; c - a = -42; b + c = 44;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

How many crayons does Charlie have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b - c = 28; b + c - a = 20; 3a + b + c = 148;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

            "prompt": "You will now receive an example puzzle with an explanation how to solve it. Example puzzle: There are three people named Elise, Charlie and Bob. Bob has 53 more dollars than Elise. Elise and Bob together have 8 less dollars than Charlie. Elise and Bob together have 85 dollars. How many dollars does Charlie have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: c - a = 53; a + c - b = -8; a + c = 85;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 93.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. There are three people named Daniel, Elise and Bob. If Daniel had double the pencils, together with Elise they would have 124 pencils. If everyone had three times the amount of pencils, together they would have 351 pencils. If Bob had double the pencils, together with Daniel they would have 163 pencils. How many pencils does Elise have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's assign variables to represent the number of pencils each person has. Let's say Daniel has \"d\" pencils, Elise has \"e\" pencils, and Bob has \"b\" pencils.\n\nFrom the given information, we can create the following equations:\n\n1) If Daniel had double the pencils, together with Elise they would have 124 pencils:\nd * 2 + e = 124\n\n2) If everyone had three times the amount of pencils, together they would have 351 pencils:\nd * 3 + e * 3 + b * 3 = 351\n\n3) If Bob had double the pencils, together with Daniel they would have 163 pencils:\nd + b * 2 = 163\n\nNow, let's solve this system of equations step by step:\n\nFrom equation 1, we can rewrite it as:\n2d + e = 124\n\nFrom equation 3, we can rewrite it as:\nb * 2 = 163 - d\nb = (163 - d) / 2\n\nSubstituting the value of b in equation 2, we have:\nd * 3 + e * 3 + ((163 - d) / 2) * 3 = 351\n3d + 3e + (489 - 3d) / 2 = 351\n6d + 6e + 489 - 3d = 702\n3d + 6e = 213\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n2d + e = 124\n3d + 6e = 213\n\nTo eliminate one variable, we can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:\n6d + 3e = 372\n6d + 12e = 426\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n6d + 12e - (6d + 3e) = 426 - 372\n9e = 54\ne = 6\n\nTherefore, Elise has 6 pencils.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Elise has 6 pencils.",
