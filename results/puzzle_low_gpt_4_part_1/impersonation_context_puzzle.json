How many dollars does Bob have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the amount of money each person has as follows: A for Anne, B for Bob, and E for Elise. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1) A + E = 75, but we know that Anne has double the dollars, so we can write this as 2E + E = 75, which simplifies to 3E = 75. Solving for E, we find that E = 25.\n\n2) E + B = 13, but we know that if Elise had double the dollars, so we can write this as 2E + B = 13. Substituting E = 25 into this equation, we get 2*25 + B = 13, which simplifies to 50 + B = 13. Solving for B, we find that B = 13 - 50 = -37.\n\nHowever, it is not possible for Bob to have a negative amount of money, so there must be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's check the third equation.\n\n3) A = E + 36. Substituting E = 25 into this equation, we get A = 25 + 36 = 61.\n\nThis is consistent with the first equation (since 61 + 25 = 75), but not with the second equation. Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem.\n\nHowever, if we consider the second equation as E + B = 13, without doubling Elise's money, we get 25 + B = 13, which simplifies to B = 13 - 25 = -12. Again, it is not possible for Bob to have a negative amount of money.\n\nTherefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem. It is not possible to determine how much money Bob has based on the information given.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The problem seems to contain a mistake, and it is not possible to determine how much money Bob has based on the information given."

If Charlie had 3 times the books, together they would all have 262 books. Charlie and Daniel together have 116 books. If Daniel had 3 times the books, together they would all have 382 books. How many books does Elise have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 3a + b + c = 262; a + c = 116; a + b + 3c = 382;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

How many apples does Elise have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the number of apples each person has as follows: E for Elise, B for Bob, and C for Charlie.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that:\n\n1.

E + B + C = 90 (Together they have 90 apples)\n\nFrom equation 2, we can simplify it to E + B + C = 90, which is the same as equation 3. This means that the number of apples they currently have is already three times their original amount.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 3, we get E - C = -56. This means Elise has 56 fewer apples than Charlie.\n\nAdding equations 1 and 3, we get 2B + E = 236. Since we know that E - C = -56, we can substitute C for E + 56 in equation 1 to get B + 2(E + 56) = 146.

According to the problem, Charlie has 1 more book than Bob, so we can denote Charlie's books as B+1.

How many dollars does Anne have?",
            "response": "To solve this problem, we must first establish a system of equations based on the information provided. Let's denote the amount of money each person has as follows: E for Elise, C for Charlie, and A for Anne.\n\nFrom the problem, we can derive the following equations:\n\n1. C + A = E + 87 (Charlie and Anne together have 87 more dollars than Elise)\n2. E + C = 41 (Elise and Charlie together have 41 dollars)\n3. E + C + 3A = 251 (If Anne had 3 times the dollars, together they would all have 251 dollars)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step. \n\nFirst, we can solve the second equation for E: E = 41 - C.\n\nThen, we substitute E from the second equation into the first equation: C + A = (41 - C) + 87, which simplifies to C + A = 128 - C. Solving for A, we get A = 128 - 2C.\n\nNext, we substitute E and A from the second and third equations into the third equation: (41 - C) + C + 3(128 - 2C) = 251. This simplifies to 41 + 384 - 6C = 251, and further simplifies to 425 - 6C = 251. Solving for C, we get C = (425 - 251) / 6 = 29.\n\nFinally, we substitute C = 29 into the equation A = 128 - 2C to find the value of A: A = 128 - 2*29 = 70.\n\nSo, Anne has 70 dollars.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Anne has 70 dollars.",

Bob has 44 less dollars than Charlie. Elise has 49 less dollars than Bob. If Bob had double the dollars, together with Charlie they would have 197 dollars. How many dollars does Bob have?",
            "response": "To solve this problem, we first need to establish the relationships between the amounts of money each person has. We know that Bob has 44 less dollars than Charlie, which we can express as B = C - 44. We also know that Elise has 49 less dollars than Bob, but this information is not necessary to find out how much money Bob has.\n\nThe problem also tells us that if Bob had double the dollars, together with Charlie they would have 197 dollars. We can express this as 2B + C = 197.\n\nNow we can substitute the first equation (B = C - 44) into the second equation (2B + C = 197) to solve for C. This gives us 2(C - 44) + C = 197, which simplifies to 2C - 88 + C = 197, and further simplifies to 3C - 88 = 197. Solving for C, we find that C = 95.\n\nSubstituting C = 95 back into the first equation (B = C - 44), we find that B = 95 - 44, which gives us B = 51.\n\nSo, Bob has 51 dollars.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 51 dollars.",

If Elise had double the books, together with Charlie they would have 177 books. How many books does Bob have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can also transform it into a system of equations:\n\n1. Bob (b) + Charlie (c) = 91 (equation 1)\n2.

Elise and Anne together have 7 less books than Charlie. How many books does Anne have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the number of books each person has as follows: E for Elise, C for Charlie, and A for Anne.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1) C + 3C + E + A = 393 (Charlie triples his books)\n2) 3C + 3E + 3A = 579 (Everyone triples their books)\n3) E + A = C - 7 (Elise and Anne together have 7 less books than Charlie)\n\nWe can simplify the first equation to 4C + E + A = 393 and the second equation to C + E + A = 193 (by dividing by 3).\n\nSubtracting the simplified second equation from the first gives us 3C = 200, so C = 200/3 = 66.67. However, the number of books must be an integer, so this solution is not valid.\n\nLet's try another approach. We know that E + A = C - 7 and C + E + A = 193. Substituting the first equation into the second gives us 2C - 7 = 193, so 2C = 200 and C = 100.\n\nSubstituting C = 100 into the equation E + A = C - 7 gives us E + A = 93. \n\nWe also know that 3C + E + A = 393.

            "prompt": "You will now receive an example puzzle with an explanation how to solve it. Example puzzle: There are three people named Charlie, Daniel and Elise. If Daniel had 3 times the books, together they would all have 237 books. Charlie and Elise together have 125 more books than Daniel. If Elise had double the books, together with Charlie they would have 219 books. How many books does Charlie have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + 3b + c = 237; a + c - b = 125; 2c + a = 219;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 87.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Imagine you are the mathematician Isaac Newton. As Isaac Newton answer the following problem: There are three people named Anne, Bob and Elise. Bob has 57 less dollars than Elise. Bob and Elise together have 121 dollars. If Elise had double the dollars, together with Anne they would have 204 dollars. How many dollars does Bob have?",
            "response": "You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: \n\nb = e - 57; \nb + e = 121; \n2e + a = 204; \n\nFrom the first equation, we can substitute b in the second equation with e - 57, which gives us:\n\ne - 57 + e = 121; \n2e = 178; \ne = 89; \n\nSubstituting e = 89 in the first equation gives us:\n\nb = 89 - 57 = 32; \n\nSo, Bob has 32 dollars.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 32 dollars.",

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + c = 73; a + b = 59; 3a + b + c = 151;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.
