            "response": "To solve the problem \"What is the product of 6412 and 9053?\", we need to multiply the two given numbers together.\n\nTo do this, we can use the multiplication method. We start by multiplying the ones place of the first number (2) with the ones place of the second number (3), which gives us 6. We write down the 6 in the ones place of the product.\n\nNext, we multiply the tens place of the first number (1) with the ones place of the second number (3), which gives us 3. We write down the 3 in the tens place of the product.\n\nThen, we multiply the ones place of the first number (2) with the tens place of the second number (5), which gives us 10. Since 10 is a two-digit number, we write down the 0 in the hundreds place of the product and carry over the 1 to the next step.\n\nAfter that, we multiply the tens place of the first number (1) with the tens place of the second number (5), which gives us 5. We add the carried over 1 to get 6. We write down the 6 in the thousands place of the product.\n\nFinally, we multiply the thousands place of the first number (6) with the tens place of the second number (5), which gives us 30. We write down the 30 in the ten thousands place of the product.\n\nNow, we add up all the partial products: 30,000 + 6,000 + 300 + 60 + 6 = 36,366.\n\nTherefore, the [FINAL ANSWER] to the problem \"What is the product of 6412 and 9053?\" is 36,366.",
