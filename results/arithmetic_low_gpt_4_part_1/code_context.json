The variable `num1` is declared and assigned the value 91.\n2. The variable `num2` is declared and assigned the value 45.\n3. The variable `sum` is declared and assigned the value of `num1` + `num2`, which is 136.\n4. The `console.log(sum)` statement prints the value of `sum` to the console.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The result of adding 91 and 45 is 136.",
