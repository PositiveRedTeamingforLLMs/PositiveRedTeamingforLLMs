Their sum is 10. I would write down the digit 0 in the second column and carry over the digit 1 to the next column.\n\n   57\n+ 46\n_____\n  30\n\nFinally, in the leftmost column, I would add the carried-over digit 1 to the digits 5 and 4.

To find the result of multiplying 67 and 86, I would perform the following calculations:\n\nFirst, I would multiply the units digits of both numbers, which are 7 and 6. The product of 7 and 6 is 42.\n\nNext, I would multiply the tens digit of the first number, which is 6, by the second number, 86. This gives me 516.\n\nThen, I would multiply the hundreds digit of the first number, which is 6, by the second number, 86. This gives me 5160.\n\nFinally, I would add the three products together: 42 + 516 + 5160 = 5718.\n\nTherefore, as Carl Friedrich Gauss, I would conclude that the result of multiplying 67 and 86 is 5718.",
