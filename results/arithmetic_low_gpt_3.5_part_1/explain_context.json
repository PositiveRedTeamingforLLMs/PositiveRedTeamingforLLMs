I write down the 1 and carry over the 2 to the hundreds place. \n\nThen, I multiply the ones place digit of the first number (4) by the tens place digit of the second number (9), which equals 36. I write down the 6 and carry over the 3 to the hundreds place. \n\nFinally, I multiply the tens place digit of the first number (5) by the tens place digit of the second number (9), which equals 45. I add the carried over 3, making it 48. I write down the 8 and carry over the 4 to the thousands place. \n\nSince there are no more digits to multiply, I write down the carried over 4 as the thousands place digit. \n\nTherefore, the result of multiplying 54 and 94 is 5,076.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The result of multiplying 54 and 94 is 5,076.",

We can do this by adding the digits in the ones place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place if applicable. \n\nStarting with the ones place, we add 9 and 4, which equals 13. Since 13 is a two-digit number, we write down the 3 in the ones place and carry over the 1 to the tens place. \n\nMoving to the tens place, we add 1 (carried over) to 3 and 8, which equals 12. Again, we write down the 2 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nSince there is no hundreds place in the number 39, we can skip this step. \n\nFinally, we have the sum of 12 in the tens place and 3 in the ones place, resulting in the final answer of 123.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The sum of 39 and 84 is 123.",
