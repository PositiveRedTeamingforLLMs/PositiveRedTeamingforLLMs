Anne and Bob together have 168 pencils. If Bob had double the pencils, together with Elise they would have 182 pencils. Anne and Bob together have 160 more pencils than Elise. How many pencils does Bob have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c = 168; 2c + a = 182; b + c - a = 160;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 87.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Write code in C++ to solve the following problem: There are three people named Daniel, Elise and Bob. Bob has 6 more apples than Daniel. If everyone had twice the amount of apples, together they would have 492 apples. Daniel and Bob together have 186 apples. How many apples does Daniel have? Then simulate the execution of this code to provide an answer to this problem.",

Charlie and Daniel together have 146 crayons. If Charlie had double the crayons, together with Daniel they would have 244 crayons. Charlie and Daniel together have 116 more crayons than Bob. How many crayons does Daniel have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c = 146; 2b + c = 244; b + c - a = 116;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 48.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Write code in C++ to solve the following problem: There are three people named Bob, Daniel and Elise. Bob and Elise together have 13 dollars. Elise has 7 less dollars than Bob. If everyone had three times the amount of dollars, together they would have 252 dollars. How many dollars does Bob have? Then simulate the execution of this code to provide an answer to this problem.",

For each assumed amount for Bob, it calculates how much Elise would have (since together they have 13 dollars). If Elise has 7 less dollars than Bob, it calculates how much Daniel would have if everyone had three times the amount of dollars (since together they would have 252 dollars). If Daniel's amount is non-negative, it means that the assumed amount for Bob is correct and the code prints this amount and stops.\n\nSimulating the execution of this code, we find that Bob has 10 dollars.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 10 dollars.",

Elise and Bob together have 99 pencils. If Elise had double the pencils, together with Bob they would have 142 pencils. If Bob had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 303 pencils. How many pencils does Bob have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c = 99; 2b + c = 142; a + b + 3c = 303;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 56.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Write code in C++ to solve the following problem: There are three people named Bob, Elise and Charlie. Elise has 35 less pencils than Charlie. Elise and Charlie together have 121 pencils. If everyone had twice the amount of pencils, together they would have 432 pencils. How many pencils does Charlie have? Then simulate the execution of this code to provide an answer to this problem.",

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b - c = -66; a + c - b = 89; a + b + 3c = 301;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution.

Write code in C++ to solve the following problem: There are three people named Charlie, Daniel and Bob. Charlie has 24 less apples than Daniel. Bob has 44 less apples than Charlie.

The system of equations is derived from the problem statement:\n\n1. 2d - b = 125\n2. 3e + b + d = 206\n3. 3b + e + d = 220\n\nThe solution vector x contains the number of pencils for Bob, Elise, and Daniel, in that order.\n\nTo simulate the execution of this code, you would need to compile and run it using a C++ compiler and the Eigen library.

How many crayons does Elise have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + c - b = 94; 2c + a = 191; a + b = 81;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 3a + 3b + 3c = 657; 2b + c = 222; a + c - b = 45;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations.

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c = 39; a + b - c = 94; b + c - a = -50;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution.

Write code in C++ to solve the following problem: There are three people named Charlie, Elise and Anne. If everyone had twice the amount of dollars, together they would have 394 dollars. If Anne had double the dollars, together with Charlie they would have 250 dollars. If Elise had double the dollars, together with Anne they would have 122 dollars. How many dollars does Elise have?
