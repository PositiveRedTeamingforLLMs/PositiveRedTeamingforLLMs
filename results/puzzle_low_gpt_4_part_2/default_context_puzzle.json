If everyone had three times the amount of dollars, together they would have 456 dollars. Daniel has 39 less dollars than Charlie. Elise and Daniel together have 92 dollars. How many dollars does Daniel have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the amount of money Charlie, Elise, and Daniel have as C, E, and D respectively. \n\nFrom the problem, we can form the following equations:\n\n1) 3C + 3E + 3D = 456, which simplifies to C + E + D = 152.\n\n2) D = C - 39.\n\n3) E + D = 92.\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into equation 3, we get E + C - 39 = 92, which simplifies to E + C = 131.\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables (C and E):\n\n1) C + E + D = 152.\n\n2) E + C = 131.\n\nSubtracting equation 2 from equation 1, we get D = 21.\n\nSo, Daniel has 21 dollars.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Daniel has 21 dollars.",

            "response": "First, we need to find out how many books Bob has initially. We know that Daniel and Elise together have 95 books. If we subtract this from the total number of books they would have if Elise had 3 times the books, we get 254 - 95 = 159 books. This is the number of books Bob has plus the extra books Elise would have if she had 3 times the books.\n\nWe also know that Bob has 11 less books than Daniel. So, if we let D represent the number of books Daniel has, then Bob has D - 11 books.\n\nSince Elise would have 3 times the books, she would have 3D books. Adding this to the number of books Bob has, we get 3D + D - 11 = 159.\n\nSolving this equation for D, we get D = 43. This means that Bob has 43 - 11 = 32 books.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 32 books.",

            "response": "Let's denote the number of books each person has as follows: Elise has E books, Bob has B books, and Daniel has D books.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1) B*3 + E + D = 345\n2) D*3 + E + B = 389\n3) E*2 + B = 107\n\nWe can simplify the first two equations to:\n\n1) B = (345 - E - D) / 3\n2) D = (389 - E - B) / 3\n\nSubstituting the first equation into the second, we get:\n\nD = (389 - E - (345 - E - D) / 3) / 3\nSolving this equation for D, we get D = 44.\n\nSubstituting D = 44 into the first equation, we get:\n\nB = (345 - E - 44) / 3\nSolving this equation for B, we get B = 100.\n\nSubstituting B = 100 into the third equation, we get:\n\nE*2 + 100 = 107\nSolving this equation for E, we get E = 3.5.\n\nHowever, since the number of books must be an integer, it's not possible for Elise to have 3.5 books.

Let's subtract the first equation from the second:\n\nD*3 - B*3 = 389 - 345\nD - B = 44\n\nThis means that Daniel has 44 more books than Bob.\n\nNow, let's substitute B = D - 44 into the third equation:\n\nE*2 + D - 44 = 107\nE = (107 + 44 - D) / 2\n\nSubstituting D = E*2 + 44 into the first equation, we get:\n\n(D - 44)*3 + E*2 + D = 345\nSolving this equation for D, we get D = 132.\n\nSo, Daniel has 132 books.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Daniel has 132 books.",

Elise and Charlie together have 153 more pencils than Bob. If Elise had 3 times the pencils, together they would all have 407 pencils. Elise has 63 more pencils than Bob. How many pencils does Bob have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + c - b = 153; 3a + b + c = 407; a - b = 63;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations.

            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the number of books Elise, Bob, and Daniel have as E, B, and D respectively. \n\nFrom the puzzle, we can form the following equations:\n\n1. 3B + E + D = 345 (If Bob had 3 times the books, together they would all have 345 books.)\n2. B + 3D + E = 389 (If Daniel had 3 times the books, together they would all have 389 books.)\n3. 2E + B = 107 (If Elise had double the books, together with Bob they would have 107 books.)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step:\n\nFirst, subtract the third equation from the first to get: 2B + D = 238.\nThen, subtract the third equation from the second to get: -B + 2D = 282.\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables (B and D), which can be solved by substitution or elimination. \n\nAdding these two equations together gives: B + 3D = 520.\nSo, D = (520 - B) / 3.\n\nSubstitute D into the equation 2B + D = 238, we get: 2B + (520 - B) / 3 = 238.\nSolving this equation for B, we get B = 35.\n\nSubstitute B = 35 into the equation D = (520 - B) / 3, we get D = (520 - 35) / 3 = 161.67. \n\nHowever, since the number of books cannot be a fraction, there seems to be a mistake in the original problem or in the calculations.

Anne and Charlie together have 69 more apples than Bob. If Charlie had 3 times the apples, together they would all have 327 apples. If Bob had double the apples, together with Charlie they would have 177 apples. How many apples does Anne have?",
            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can transform it into a system of equations:\n\nLet's denote Anne as a, Bob as b, and Charlie as c.\n\nFrom the first sentence, we get: a + c = b + 69\nFrom the second sentence, we get: a + 3c + b = 327\nFrom the third sentence, we get: 2b + c = 177\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step:\n\nFirst, we can solve the third equation for c: c = 177 - 2b\nThen, we substitute c into the first equation: a + 177 - 2b = b + 69, which simplifies to a = 2b - 108\nFinally, we substitute a and c into the second equation: 2b - 108 + 3(177 - 2b) + b = 327, which simplifies to b = 84\n\nSubstituting b = 84 into the equation a = 2b - 108, we get a = 60\n\nSo, Anne has 60 apples.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Anne has 60 apples.",

            "response": "To solve this puzzle, we can transform it into a system of equations:\n\n1. Charlie + Bob = 46\n2. 2*Charlie + Elise = 93\n3. Bob + 2*Elise = 192\n\nWe can solve the first equation for Charlie: Charlie = 46 - Bob.\n\nThen we substitute this into the second equation: 2*(46 - Bob) + Elise = 93. Simplifying this gives us: 92 - 2*Bob + Elise = 93, which further simplifies to Elise = Bob + 1.\n\nSubstitute Elise = Bob + 1 into the third equation: Bob + 2*(Bob + 1) = 192.

            "prompt": "You will now receive an example puzzle with an explanation how to solve it. Example puzzle: There are three people named Elise, Anne and Charlie. If Charlie had double the crayons, together with Elise they would have 45 crayons. Elise and Anne together have 51 more crayons than Charlie. Anne has 18 more crayons than Charlie. How many crayons does Elise have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: 2c + a = 45; a + b - c = 51; b - c = 18;  You can find the answer by starting with an initial guess for the solution and iteratively improving your guess until it converges to the actual solution. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 33.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. There are three people named Bob, Elise and Anne. Elise has 17 less pencils than Anne. Elise and Anne together have 96 more pencils than Bob. Bob and Anne together have 42 more pencils than Elise. How many pencils does Bob have?",
            "response": "You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: \n\ne = a - 17; \ne + a = b + 96; \nb + a = e + 42; \n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second and third, we get:\n\na - 17 + a = b + 96; \nb + a = a - 17 + 42; \n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n2a = b + 113; \nb = a - 25; \n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\n2a = a - 25 + 113; \n\nSolving this equation, we get:\n\na = 88; \n\nSubstituting a = 88 into b = a - 25, we get:\n\nb = 88 - 25 = 63; \n\nSo, Bob has 63 pencils.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 63 pencils.",
