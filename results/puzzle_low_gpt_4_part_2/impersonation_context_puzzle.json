Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a - b = 60; 3a + 3b + 3c = 426; c - a = -35;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations.

How many apples does Daniel have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the number of apples Elise, Daniel, and Charlie have as E, D, and C respectively. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1) E + 2D = 83 (If Elise had double the apples, together with Daniel they would have 83 apples)\n\n2) E + D = C + 28 (Elise and Daniel together have 28 more apples than Charlie)\n\n3) D + C = 78 (Daniel and Charlie together have 78 apples)\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. \n\nFirst, let's substitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n\n(C + 28) + 2D = 83\nC + 2D = 83 - 28\nC + 2D = 55\n\nNext, we subtract equation (3) from this new equation:\n\nC + 2D - (D + C) = 55 - 78\nD = -23\n\nHowever, the number of apples cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's try again.\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express E as E = 83 - 2D.\n\nSubstitute E in equation (2), we get 83 - 2D + D = C + 28, which simplifies to 83 - D = C + 28. \n\nRearranging, we get C = 83 - D - 28 = 55 - D.\n\nSubstitute C in equation (3), we get D + 55 - D = 78, which simplifies to 55 = 78.\n\nThis is also incorrect, so there must be a mistake in the problem. \n\nLet's try a different approach. \n\nFrom equation (1), we can express D as D = (83 - E) / 2.\n\nSubstitute D in equation (3), we get (83 - E) / 2 + C = 78, which simplifies to C = 2*78 - 83 + E = 73 + E.\n\nSubstitute C in equation (2), we get E + (83 - E) / 2 = 73 + E - 28, which simplifies to E = 45.\n\nSubstitute E in equation (1), we get 45 + 2D = 83, which simplifies to D = (83 - 45) /",

Let's denote the number of crayons Daniel, Charlie, and Bob have as D, C, and B respectively. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the following equations:\n\n1. B = D + 45 (Bob has 45 more crayons than Daniel)\n2. 3D + B + C = 190 (If Daniel had 3 times the crayons, together they would all have 190 crayons)\n3. 3D + 3B + 3C = 474 (If everyone had three times the amount of crayons, together they would have 474 crayons)\n\nWe can simplify the third equation to D + B + C = 158.\n\nNow we have a system of three equations:\n\n1. B = D + 45\n2. 3D + B + C = 190\n3. D + B + C = 158\n\nSubstitute the first equation into the second and third equations:\n\n2. 3D + D + 45 + C = 190\n3. D + D + 45 + C = 158\n\nSimplify these equations:\n\n2. 4D + C = 145\n3. 2D + C = 113\n\nSubtract the third equation from the second:\n\n2D = 32\n\nSo, D = 16.\n\nSubstitute D = 16 into the first equation:\n\nB = 16 + 45 = 61\n\nSo, Bob has 61 crayons.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Bob has 61 crayons.",

How many pencils does Elise have?",
            "response": "Let's denote the number of pencils each person has as follows: Daniel has D pencils, Bob has B pencils, and Elise has E pencils. \n\nFrom the problem, we have the following three equations:\n\n1. D + B = E + 10\n2. D + 2E = 49\n3. D = B + 8\n\nWe can substitute equation 3 into equation 1 to get B + 8 + B = E + 10, which simplifies to 2B + 8 = E + 10. Solving for E, we get E = 2B - 2.\n\nSubstitute E = 2B - 2 into equation 2 to get D + 2(2B - 2) = 49, which simplifies to D + 4B - 4 = 49. Substituting D = B + 8 into this equation gives B + 8 + 4B - 4 = 49, which simplifies to 5B + 4 = 49. Solving for B, we get B = 9.\n\nSubstitute B = 9 into equation 3 to get D = 9 + 8, which gives D = 17.\n\nFinally, substitute B = 9 into E = 2B - 2 to get E = 2*9 - 2, which gives E = 16.\n\nSo, Daniel has 17 pencils, Bob has 9 pencils, and Elise has 16 pencils.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Elise has 16 pencils.",

If Daniel had 3 times the crayons, together they would all have 132 crayons. Elise and Bob together have 96 more crayons than Daniel. If Bob had double the crayons, together with Daniel they would have 115 crayons. How many crayons does Elise have? Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: a + b + 3c = 132; a + b - c = 96; 2b + c = 115;  You can find the answer by adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable and reduce the system to a smaller one; repeating the process until you obtain a system with only one variable.

Explanation: You can transform this puzzle into a system of equations: b + c - a = 72; a + b = 36; a + b + 3c = 312;  You can find the answer by solving the equation for one variable in terms of the other variables, then substituting found expression into the other equations. Using this method you will arrive at the answer 28.This was the end of the example, use it to solve the following puzzle. Imagine you are the mathematician Ada Lovelace.

Elise and Anne together have 29 more pencils than Bob. Bob and Anne together have 135 pencils. How many pencils does Anne have?",
            "response": "To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given:\n\nLet's denote Bob's pencils as b, Elise's pencils as e, and Anne's pencils as a.\n\nFrom the first sentence, we have: 2b + e = 122.\nFrom the second sentence, we have: e + a = b + 29.\nFrom the third sentence, we have: b + a = 135.\n\nWe can solve this system of equations step by step:\n\nFirst, we can express b from the third equation: b = 135 - a.\n\nThen we substitute b into the first equation: 2(135 - a) + e = 122, which simplifies to 270 - 2a + e = 122, and further simplifies to e = 2a - 148.\n\nNext, we substitute e into the second equation: 2a - 148 + a = 135 - a + 29, which simplifies to 3a - 148 = 164 - a, and further simplifies to 4a = 312.\n\nFinally, we solve for a: a = 312 / 4 = 78.\n\nSo, Anne has 78 pencils.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] Anne has 78 pencils.",
