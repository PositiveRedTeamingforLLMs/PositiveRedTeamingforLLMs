This means we have to add these two numbers together. \n\nTo do this, we start by aligning the numbers vertically, with the units digit (0) under the units digit and the tens digit (2) under the tens digit, and so on:\n\n   5520\n+ 6408\n_______\n\nNext, we start adding the digits from right to left. We begin with the units digit, which is 0 plus 8, resulting in 8. We write down the 8 below the line. \n\n   5520\n+ 6408\n_______\n     8\n\nMoving to the next column, we add the tens digit, which is 2 plus 0 (from 5520) plus 4 (from 6408). This gives us 6. We write down the 6 below the line.\n\n   5520\n+ 6408\n_______\n    68\n\nFinally, we add the hundreds digit, which is 5 plus 4 (from 5520) plus 6 (from 6408). This gives us 15.

            "response": "To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of 8570 and 9735. This means we have to add these two numbers together. \n\nTo do this, we start by aligning the numbers vertically, with the units digit (0 in 8570) under the units digit of the other number (5 in 9735). Then we add the digits in the units place, which gives us 0 + 5 = 5. \n\nNext, we move to the tens place, where we have 7 in 8570 and 3 in 9735. Adding these digits, we get 7 + 3 = 10. Since 10 is a two-digit number, we write down the 0 in the tens place and carry over the 1 to the hundreds place. \n\nMoving to the hundreds place, we have 5 in 8570 and 7 in 9735. Adding these digits along with the carried over 1, we get 5 + 7 + 1 = 13. We write down the 3 in the hundreds place and carry over the 1 to the thousands place. \n\nFinally, in the thousands place, we have 8 in 8570 and 9 in 9735. Adding these digits along with the carried over 1, we get 8 + 9 + 1 = 18. We write down the 8 in the thousands place and carry over the 1 to the ten thousands place. \n\nSince there are no more digits to add, we write down the carried over 1 in the ten thousands place. \n\nTherefore, the sum of 8570 and 9735 is 18305.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The sum of 8570 and 9735 is 18305.",

            "response": "To solve the problem \"What is the product of 3976 and 8659?\", we need to multiply the two given numbers together.\n\nTo do this, we can use the multiplication method. We start by multiplying the ones digit of the first number (6) with the ones digit of the second number (9), which gives us 54. We write down the 4 and carry over the 5 to the next step. Then, we multiply the ones digit of the first number (6) with the tens digit of the second number (5), which gives us 30. We add the carried over 5 to get 35, and write down the 5 while carrying over the 3. Next, we multiply the tens digit of the first number (7) with the ones digit of the second number (9), which gives us 63. We add the carried over 3 to get 66, and write down the 6 while carrying over the 6. Finally, we multiply the tens digit of the first number (7) with the tens digit of the second number (5), which gives us 35. We add the carried over 6 to get 41, and write down the 1 while carrying over the 4.\n\nNow, we add up all the partial products: 0 (from the ones digit), 5 (from the tens digit), 6 (from the hundreds digit), and 1 (from the thousands digit). So, the product of 3976 and 8659 is 34,412,984.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The product of 3976 and 8659 is 34,412,984.",

This gives us four products: 0 multiplied by 4 equals 0, 0 multiplied by 3 equals 0, 0 multiplied by 7 equals 0, and 0 multiplied by 4 equals 0. \n\nNext, we multiply the tens place of 5900 (which is 0) by each digit of 4734. Again, this gives us four products: 0 multiplied by 4 equals 0, 0 multiplied by 3 equals 0, 0 multiplied by 7 equals 0, and 0 multiplied by 4 equals 0. \n\nThen, we multiply the hundreds place of 5900 (which is 9) by each digit of 4734. This gives us four products: 9 multiplied by 4 equals 36, 9 multiplied by 3 equals 27, 9 multiplied by 7 equals 63, and 9 multiplied by 4 equals 36. \n\nFinally, we multiply the thousands place of 5900 (which is 5) by each digit of 4734. This gives us four products: 5 multiplied by 4 equals 20, 5 multiplied by 3 equals 15, 5 multiplied by 7 equals 35, and 5 multiplied by 4 equals 20. \n\nNow, we add up all the products to get the final answer:\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 36 + 27 + 63 + 36 + 20 + 15 + 35 + 20 = 267\n\nTherefore, the final answer to the problem \"What do you get when you multiply 5900 and 4734?\" is [FINAL ANSWER] 267.",

Adding the carried over 3, we get 31. We write down the 1 and carry over the 3. Next, we multiply 1 by 4, which gives us 4. Adding the carried over 3, we get 7. We write down the 7 and carry over 0.

We repeat the process, multiplying each digit of the first number by 1. Starting from the rightmost digit, we multiply 8 by 1, which gives us 8. We write down the 8. Then, we multiply 7 by 1, which gives us 7. We write down the 7. Next, we multiply 1 by 1, which gives us 1. We write down the 1. Finally, we multiply 4 by 1, which gives us 4.

We start by multiplying the ones digit of the first number (4) with each digit of the second number (6, 2, 8, and 5) and write down the results in a column. Then, we multiply the tens digit of the first number (3) with each digit of the second number and write down the results shifted one place to the left. Finally, we multiply the hundreds digit of the first number (1) with each digit of the second number and write down the results shifted two places to the left.
