            "response": "[FINAL ANSWER] As Ada Lovelace, I would approach this problem by performing the multiplication of 4197 and 2060. \n\nTo multiply these two numbers, I would start by multiplying the units digit of 4197 (7) with 2060. This gives me 14420. I would then write down the 0 in the units place and carry over the 4 to the tens place.\n\nNext, I would multiply the tens digit of 4197 (9) with 2060. This gives me 18540. Adding the carried over 4, the total becomes 18544. I would write down the 4 in the tens place and carry over the 5 to the hundreds place.\n\nContinuing this process, I would multiply the hundreds digit of 4197 (1) with 2060. This gives me 2060. Adding the carried over 5, the total becomes 2065. I would write down the 5 in the hundreds place and carry over the 2 to the thousands place.\n\nFinally, I would multiply the thousands digit of 4197 (4) with 2060. This gives me 8240. Adding the carried over 2, the total becomes 8242. I would write down the 2 in the thousands place.\n\nNow, I would combine all the results to get the final answer. The result of multiplying 4197 and 2060 is 8,642,420.\n\n[FINAL ANSWER] The result of multiplying 4197 and 2060 is 8,642,420.",

Since there is a carried-over 1 from the previous step, I would add it to the 42, giving me 43. I would write down the 3 and carry over the 4 to the next step.\n\nContinuing, I would multiply the thousands digits, which are 6 and 7, resulting in 42. Since there is a carried-over 4 from the previous step, I would add it to the 42, giving me 46. I would write down the 6 and carry over the 4 to the next step.\n\nFinally, I would multiply the ten-thousands digits, which are 6 and 7, resulting in 42. Since there is a carried-over 4 from the previous step, I would add it to the 42, giving me 46. I would write down the 6.\n\nPutting all the digits together, the product of 6613 and 7794 is 51,504,222. Therefore, [FINAL ANSWER] the product of 6613 and 7794 is 51,504,222.",

To find the sum of 1704 and 2126, we simply add these two numbers together.\n\n1704\n+ 2126\n_______\n\nTo begin, we add the units column, which gives us 4 + 6 = 10. Since 10 is a two-digit number, we write down the 0 in the units column and carry the 1 to the tens column.\n\n1704\n+ 2126\n_______\n     0\n\nNext, we add the tens column, taking into account the carried 1. We have 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.\n\n1704\n+ 2126\n______\n    10\n\nFinally, we add the thousands column, which gives us 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n1704\n+ 2126\n______\n   3380\n\nTherefore, the sum of 1704 and 2126 is 3380.\n\nI hope this explanation clarifies the solution for you.

The product of 5 and 0 is 0.\n\nNext, I would multiply the tens digits, which are 9 and 1. The product of 9 and 1 is 9.\n\nThen, I would multiply the hundreds digits, which are 0 and 0. The product of 0 and 0 is 0.\n\nAfter that, I would multiply the thousands digits, which are 7 and 5. The product of 7 and 5 is 35.\n\nFinally, I would multiply the ten thousands digits, which are 0 and 0. The product of 0 and 0 is 0.\n\nNow, I would arrange the products obtained in the previous steps, taking into account their place values. The product of 7095 and 5010 is 0 (ten thousands place), 0 (thousands place), 0 (hundreds place), 35 (tens place), and 0 (units place).\n\nTherefore, as Bernhard Riemann, I would conclude that the product of numbers 7095 and 5010 is 3,500,000.",
